    <marquee direction="left"><h1 id="title_text">There are nearly 17,000 asteroids orbiting our Planet.
    These Near Earth Objects, or NEOs are closer to Earth than the Moon.
    We wish to learn more and discover.
    Earth is bombarded with more than 100 tons of dust and sand-sized particles, every single day.
    An asteroid the size of an automobile is enought to create a massive fireball in the sky.
    Once every 2,000 years, Earth suffers significant area damage due to a meteroid the size of a football field.
    An object large enough to threaten Earth's civilization comes once every few million years.   
    It is believed that an object between one and two kilometers could have catastrophic effects on our planet.
    The largest known asteroid near Earth is Toutatis at 5.4 kilometers in diameter.

    By comparison, space rocks which populate the main Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter, can be as big as 940 kilometers.
