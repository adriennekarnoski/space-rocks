    An asteroid's orbit is computed by finding the elliptical path about the sun 
    that best fits the available observations of the object. 
    That is, the object's computed path about the sun is adjusted until the predictions
    of where the asteroid should have appeared in the sky at several observed times match 
    the positions where the object was actually observed to be at those same times. 
    As more and more observations are used to further improve an object's orbit,</h1></marquee>
